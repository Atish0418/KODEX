## 🧠 What This Project Does

When the user clicks the “GENERATE CARD” button:

* A new card is created dynamically.
* Each card receives a **random RGB background color**.
* Each card gets a **random width and height**.
* Each card gets a **unique `data-id`** attribute.
* Cards are displayed in a responsive layout.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 💡 Dynamically created cards using JavaScript
* 🎨 Randomized colors using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`
* 📏 Random width and height
* 🔢 Each card has a unique identifier (`data-id`)
* 📱 Responsive layout
* 🧼 Clean and simple UI

## 🛠️ How It Works

The core logic uses:

1. **DOM Manipulation**
   Creating elements (`document.createElement`) and appending them to the page.

2. **Randomization**

   * RGB color values generated using:

     ```js
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 256)
     ```
   * Width and height randomly calculated within a range.

3. **Unique IDs**
   Each new card gets a unique `data-id`:

   ```js
   card.setAttribute("data-id", idCounter);
   ```
